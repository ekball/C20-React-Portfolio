            Hello, my name is Kyles and I am currently a dog trainer at Petco. I have been training dogs for about 4 years now. I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill in 2017 with a B.A. in German Studies and a minor in Linguistics. 
            Coding has always been an interest of mine, but I did not have the opportunity to learn it in a formal environment until I enrolled in the UNC Coding Bootcamp in Fall 2021. 
            I would like to find a position that revolves around web development or creating independent projects for people.
      </p>
